# Toni-Grubesic

**Mechanical Engineer ‚Äî Test Automation ‚Ä¢ DFM ‚Ä¢ Prototyping**

I design and build systems that work in the lab *and* on the floor‚Äîcombining Python/LabVIEW instrument control, CAD/CAM, and hands-on manufacturing (CNC, welding, composites, 3D printing). My recent work spans battery testing automation, environmental chambers, and on-bike telemetry.

- **What I do:** multi-instrument control (SCPI/serial), data pipelines & QC, test fixtures, rugged enclosures, DFM/DFA.
- **Domains:** batteries & thermal, HVAC systems, automotive/motorcycle electronics.
- **Values:** repeatable tests, safety interlocks, readable code, version control, clear documentation.

### Toolbox
- **Software:** Python (pandas, matplotlib; serial/SCPI), LabVIEW, MATLAB, SolidWorks, Fusion 360, GD&T, basic FEA, Fusion CAM, Git
- **Hardware:** DAQ, battery cyclers, PSUs, environmental chambers, 3-axis CNC, manual mill/lathe, MIG/TIG, carbon fiber layup, FDM printing (PETG/TPU)
- **Protocols:** UART/I¬≤C/SPI, CAN (basics), TCP/IP

### Selected Projects
- **Battery Test Automation (LLNL)** ‚Äî Python/LabVIEW framework orchestrating cyclers, PSUs, and chambers with real-time logging, QC thresholds, and auto-reports.  
- **Motorcycle Telemetry & Lean-Angle System** ‚Äî custom PCB + firmware + UI integrating 9-axis IMU, TPMS/ECU, and GPS for real-time analytics.  
- **SAE Baja (Chassis & Welding)** ‚Äî designed/welded chassis components; validated for strength/rigidity.

### Currently
- Building robust, recipe-driven test automation and refining on-bike telemetry UX.
